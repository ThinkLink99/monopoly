# Linkopoly

## About the Project
Linkopoly is a monopoly recreation project developed by Trey Hall ([ThinkLink99](http://www.github.com/thinklink99)) as a way for easier set up of an already long board game.

## Planned Features
As this is a recreation of the game, the core gameplay mechanics will be required, however below is a list of other planned features.

* A Mafia system: A true capatalist experience is incomplete without the looming threat of a mob hit on your infrastructure.
  * The Mafia would be a seperate entity, like the banker, and can be called  upon by any player in the game, in secret, to steal money, destroy houses etc..
  * All players would be alerted to a mob hit, but no one would be told who called the hit. Any money stolen would go into the mob caller's account and only that player will be alerted to a transaction.
  
* Housing Interest: Let's face it, the game is too cut and dry and after all the board has been bought up, there is no real way to earn more money as a small player. That's where housing interest comes in. 
  * Housing interest will take into account how long a player has owned a property, how many houses are on the property and how many times rent has been collected on that property. 
  * Players could mortage their property for theoreticallly more than the original buying price. This would stop mega monopolies from easily crushing small players.
